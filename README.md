## üåü Key Features

- **Secure & Modern User Authentication**

   -Robust user registration and login system using industry-standard practices.
   - Secure password handling with Bcrypt for hashing and salting.
   - Stateful sessions managed by JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring that user data is protected and access to routes is controlled.
   - Custom middleware protects critical API endpoints, allowing     access only to authenticated users.

- **Dynamic Poll Creation & Management**
   - Users can create polls with custom questions and multiple-choice options.
   - Functionality to track poll responses and view results in real-time.
   - A personalized dashboard allows users to view and manage the polls they have created.
   - Users can bookmark their favorite or most relevant polls for quick access.

- **Sleek, Responsive, and Intuitive UI**
   - The entire frontend is built with React, creating a fast, single-page application (SPA) experience.
   - A clean, modern, and fully responsive interface designed with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a flawless experience on any device, from mobile phones to desktops.
   - User feedback is enhanced with non-intrusive toast notifications via React Hot Toast.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Decisions & Core Utilities
This project was built with a focus on creating a scalable, maintainable, and robust backend. The architecture is designed to be clean, efficient, and easy to reason about.

1. **Standardized API Communication (ApiResponse & ApiError)**
To ensure consistency and predictability for the client-side, all API responses and errors follow a standardized structure. This simplifies frontend logic for handling data and errors.

   - **ApiResponse.js**: A utility class for sending successful, well-structured JSON responses. It automatically sets the success flag based on the HTTP status code.

```js
class ApiResponse {
   constructor(statusCode, data, message = "Success") {
      this.statusCode = statusCode;
      this.data = data;
      this.message = message;
      this.success = statusCode < 400;
    }
}
```
   - **ApiError.js**: A custom error class that extends Node.js's native Error class. It allows for throwing operational errors with specific HTTP status codes and detailed error messages, which are then caught by our central error handler.

```js
class ApiError extends Error {
    constructor(
        statusCode,
        message = "Something went wrong",
        errors = [],
        stack = ""
    ) {
        super(message);
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.data = null;
        this.message = message;
        this.success = false;
        this.errors = errors;

        if (stack) {
            this.stack = stack;
        } else {
            Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
        }
    }
}
```
2. **Asynchronous Error Handling (asyncHandler)**
To avoid cluttering our controllers with repetitive try...catch blocks, we use a higher-order function wrapper.

   - **asyncHandler.js**: This utility wraps our asynchronous Express route handlers. It resolves the promise and automatically catches any errors, passing them to the next middleware. This centralizes error handling and keeps controller logic clean and focused on business operations.
```js
const asyncHandler = (requestHandler) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next))
               .catch((err) => next(err));
    };
};
```

3. **Scalable Data Modeling with Mongoose**
The database schema is designed for scalability and clear relationships between entities using Mongoose.

**Users**: Stores user credentials, profile information, and references to polls they have created or bookmarked.

**Polls**: Contains the poll question, options, and references to the creator.
